# ThemesGuide Tophat Themes

Free, open source themes to give Bootstrap 4 a custom, stylish look.

Give your Bootstrap 4 projects a unique, custom style. Simply download the `theme.css` file for any 
theme, and include it after the standard bootstrap.css in your project's HTML templates. 
Each theme also includes example layout templates to demonstrate Bootstrap 4 elements, components, and content integration.

## Usage

Clone this repository or download individual themes as desired. Each theme folder contains a `theme.css` file which is the 
custom styles (colors, fonts, etc..) that you can use for your Bootstrap 4 projects. The `theme.css` file should always follow
the `bootstrap.css`:

```
<link href="/path/to/bootstrap.min.css">
<link href="/path/to/theme.css">

```

Additionally, each theme folder contains example layout templates to get your started. Each template has a corresponding `template.css`
 with styles specific to each template, but it's use is optional, and unrelated to the theme styles in `theme.css`.

- index.html (default)
- template1.html
- template2.html

**All themes use the latest Bootstrap 4**
